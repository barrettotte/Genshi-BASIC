# Genshi-BASIC
An interpreter for Genshi BASIC; A BASIC dialect based on Commodore 64 BASIC.

Even though writing an interpreter for a custom BASIC dialect is pretty useless, the same 
lexing, parsing, and interpreting fundamentals I learned can be applied to other languages.


## Genshi BASIC
Genshi BASIC has ?? keywords and ? symbolic operators. TODO:
As stated above, the grammar is based on Commodore 64 BASIC.

Genshi (原始) means simple in romaji.

**Rewritten in 2020** to reflect the new things I've learned since my first implementation.
The original scuffed implementation can be found in [docs/archived/](docs/archived/).
