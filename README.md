# Genshi-BASIC

An interpreter for Genshi BASIC; A BASIC dialect based on Commodore 64 BASIC.

Even though writing an interpreter for a custom BASIC dialect is pretty useless, the same 
lexing, parsing, and interpreting fundamentals I learned can be applied to other languages.


## Genshi BASIC
Genshi BASIC has 50 keywords and 7 symbolic operators.
As stated above, the grammar is based on Commodore 64 BASIC.

Genshi (原始) means simple in romaji.

**Rewritten 11/15/20** to reflect the concepts I've learned since the original implementation.

The original scuffed implementation can be found in [docs/archived/](docs/archived/)
